This is a work-in-progress Kotlin rewrite of the [Kings-World/fabric-mod](https://github.com/Kings-World/fabric-mod) repository. The reason for the change of repo is that I wanted to try and improve the name.

The current version of the mod (in the old repo) can be found on Modrinth here: https://modrinth.com/mod/kings-world.

## Warning

I am still learning Kotlin, so if you have any improvements, feel free to make a PR.
